Implementation of Coordinate System Transformations 

Objective: To familiarize oneself with different coordinate systems (Cartesian, polar, and spherical) and gain practical skills in transitioning between them. To determine the computational efficiency of distance calculations in these coordinate systems through benchmarking.

Solution:
